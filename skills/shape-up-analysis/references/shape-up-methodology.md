# Shape Up Methodology Reference

Quick reference for Shape Up concepts relevant to pitch analysis.

## Core Principles

### Fixed Time, Variable Scope
- Time is fixed (appetite), scope flexes to fit
- 6-week cycles for big batches, 2-week for small batches
- If it doesn't fit, cut scope—never extend time

### Appetite vs Estimates
| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Appetite | "How much time do we want to spend?" (constraint) |
| Estimate | "How long will this take?" (prediction) |

Appetite is a budget, not a deadline. Shape work to fit the appetite.

### Shaping vs Building
- **Shaping**: Senior people define rough solution, boundaries, and risks
- **Building**: Team has full autonomy within shaped boundaries

## Pitch Anatomy

A well-shaped pitch contains:

### 1. Problem
- Raw idea or use case triggering the work
- Jobs-to-be-done framing preferred
- Must be specific, not vague "improvements"

**Red flags in problem statements:**
- Solution disguised as problem ("We need to add X")
- Too abstract ("Improve user experience")
- Missing "who" and "why"

### 2. Appetite
- Small batch: 2 weeks
- Big batch: 6 weeks
- Determines how much solution to design

### 3. Solution
- Rough enough to leave room for creativity
- Specific enough to show it's doable
- Usually includes fat marker sketches or breadboards

**Breadboard elements:**
- Places (screens/pages)
- Affordances (buttons, fields, interface elements)
- Connection lines (flow between places)

### 4. Rabbit Holes
- Known areas of complexity to avoid or timebox
- Technical traps that could blow up scope
- Edge cases explicitly out of scope

### 5. No-Gos
- Explicit exclusions
- Things that might seem in scope but aren't
- Prevents scope creep during building

## Betting Table Criteria

Questions the betting table asks:

1. **Does the problem matter?** - Real pain vs nice-to-have
2. **Is the appetite right?** - Worth this much time?
3. **Is the solution attractive?** - Will it actually solve the problem?
4. **Is this the right time?** - Dependencies, strategic fit
5. **Are the right people available?** - Team capacity

## Scope Hammering Techniques

When scope doesn't fit appetite:

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Cut | Remove entire features |
| Thin | Reduce fidelity of features |
| Defer | Move to future cycle |
| Simplify | Find easier implementation |

## Hill Charts

Track progress during building:

```
      🔵 Figuring out        ✅ Making it happen
         ↗                        ↘
    ────────────────────────────────────
```

- Left side: Uncertainty, exploration
- Top: Major unknowns resolved
- Right side: Execution, known work
- Scopes should move left-to-right, never backward

## Circuit Breaker

If a project isn't converging by 2/3 through cycle:
- Don't automatically extend
- Evaluate: Can we still deliver value?
- Options: Ship what works, kill it, re-pitch next cycle

## Scope Language

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Must-have | Core to solving the problem |
| Nice-to-have | Valuable but cuttable |
| Out of scope | Explicitly excluded |
| Won't fix | Known issues we accept |
